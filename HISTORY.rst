.. _section-3:

1.0.0 (2017-11-01)
------------------

-  Incompatible API change: it is required to specify ``time_unit`` in
   ``InstanceClass``, ``PerformanceSet`` and ``Workload`` classes, in
   order to clarify the time unit for price, performance and workload
   timeslots.
-  Added utility function to read solutions from yaml files.
-  Revised documentation and code quality. Improved README for github.

.. _section-4:

1.0.1 (2018-01-12)

-  New class ``PhaseIIGuided`` which allows to solve a single timeslot
   using a given allocation which specifies the minimum number of VMs to
   keep running.

.. _section-6:

2.1.1 (2019-06-20)
------------------

-  Internal refactorization of Malloovia Modelâ€™s classes, which are now
   based on ``typing.NamedTuple`` instead of ``collections.namedtuple``,
   which allows for proper type checking and documentation of the
   fields.
