class MallooviaLp:
    """Solves the allocation problem, using Linear Programming.

    This class contains methods to create a linear programming problem
    (using PuLP), to add restrictions and extra variables to it,
    to solve it (using PuLP supported solvers), and to retrieve
    the solution in a format amenable to further analysis and display.

    The LP problem instantiates these variables:

    - For reserved instances: ``Y_(_a,_ic)``, where ``Y`` is a fixed prefix,
      ``a`` is a string representation of each application and ``ic`` is the string
      representation of each reserved instance class considered.
      After solving the LP problem, the value of the variable is the number of
      reserved machines of instance class `ic` for application `a`, for the whole
      reservation period.

    - For on-demand instances: ``X_(_a,_ic,_l)``, where ``X`` is a fixed prefix,
      ``a`` is a string representation of each application, ``ic`` is the string
      representation of each on-demand instance class considered and ``l`` is a
      string representation of a "workload tuple", which is a tuple of numbers,
      e.g: ``(1230, 442, 123)``, each one representing the workload of one of the apps.
      After solving the LP problem, the value of the variable is the number of
      on-demand machines of instance class `ic` deployed for application `a` at a
      timeslot which has a workload prediction equal to the tuple ``l``.

    Intended usage:

    1. Instantiate the class (see constructor parameters below).
    2. Call object's ``.create_problem()``.
    3. Call object's ``.solve()``.
    4. Retrieve solution by calling object's ``.get_allocation()`` to get the solution
       for all variables, or ``.get_reserved_allocation()`` to get ony the number of
       reserved instances of each type.
    5. Retrieve the cost of the solution via object's ``.get_solution()``.

    You can use object's property ``pulp_problem`` to access the PuLP problem object
    which represents the linear programming problem, to inspect or save it if required.
